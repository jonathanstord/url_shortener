Instructions:

The only prequisite to spinning up this application or running the tests is docker and docker-compose.
Everything should be handled within the docker container itself, so no need to install other dependencies.

To build a docker image, use make setup. Once you have a docker image, you are good to run the tests or spin up the
application.

To run the tests, use make test. This will spin up a docker container, spin up the test db inside, run the tests, and then
spin down the container.

To run the application, use make server. This will spin up the application on port 8080. You can use ctrl + c to stop
the application from running in the current terminal.

Notes:

The first time build is time consuming. Some of the gems (especially sassc) take a while to install. It will finish
eventually. In a real application, I would spend more time optimizing this.
